A Yocto / OpenEmbedded layer to develop MicroOS packages

Currently there are 50000 binary packages represented in this
repository.  Before adding the layer, increase the maximum allowed
watches for inotify:

    sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=60000

The layer can be added with:

    bitbake-layers add-layer meta-microos
