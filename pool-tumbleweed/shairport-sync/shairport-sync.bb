SUMMARY = "An AirPlay audio player"
DESCRIPTION = "Shairport Sync is an AirPlay audio player â€“ it plays audio streamed from iTunes, \
iOS, Apple TV and macOS devices and AirPlay sources such as Quicktime Player and \
ForkedDaapd, among others. \
 \
Audio played by a Shairport Sync-powered device stays synchronised with the \
source and hence with similar devices playing the same source. In this way, \
synchronised multi-room audio is possible for players that support it, such as \
iTunes. \
 \
Shairport Sync runs on Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD. It does not support AirPlay \
video or photo streaming."
