SUMMARY = "High-performance and widely portable implementation of MPI"
DESCRIPTION = "MPICH is a high performance and widely portable implementation of the Message \
Passing Interface (MPI) standard. \
 \
The goals of MPICH are: \
 \
 * to provide an MPI implementation that efficiently supports different \
   computation and communication platforms including commodity clusters \
   (desktop systems, shared-memory systems, multicore architectures), \
   high-speed networks and proprietary high-end computing systems \
   (Blue Gene, Cray) \
 * to enable cutting-edge research in MPI through an easy-to-extend modular \
   framework for other derived implementations"
