SUMMARY = "Shims to make deprecation of pytz easier"
DESCRIPTION = "pytz has served the Python community well for many years, but it is no longer \
the best option for providing time zones. pytz has a non-standard interface \
that is very easy to misuse; this interface was necessary when pytz was \
created, because datetime had no way to represent ambiguous datetimes, but this \
was solved in in Python 3.6, which added a fold attribute to datetimes in PEP \
495. With the addition of the zoneinfo module in Python 3.9 (PEP 615), there \
has never been a better time to migrate away from pytz. \
 \
However, since pytz time zones are used very differently from a standard \
tzinfo, and many libraries have built pytz zones into their standard time zone \
interface (and thus may have users relying on the existence of the localize and \
normalize methods); this library provides shim classes that are compatible with \
both PEP 495 and pytzâ€™s interface, to make it easier for libraries to deprecate \
pytz."
