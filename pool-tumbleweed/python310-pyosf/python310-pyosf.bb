SUMMARY = "Python lib for synching with OpenScienceFramework projects"
DESCRIPTION = "The pyosf package is a pure Python library for file sync with \
Open Science Framework. \
 \
This package is for synchronisation of files from the local \
file space to the Open Science Framework (OSF). There is a more \
complex sync package by the Center for Open Science, \
who created OSF, called osf-sync. \
 \
The OSF official package is designed for continuous automated \
synchronisation of many projects (Ã  la Dropbox). The authors of pyosf \
needed something simpler (for combination with PsychoPy). The pyosf \
package performs basic search/login/sync operations with single \
projects on OSF, but only when instructed to do so (no continuous \
sync)."
