C. This library provides SPDY version 2, 3 and 3.1 framing layer \
implementation. It does not perform any I/O operations but uses \
callback functions provided by the application. Likewise, it includes \
no event polling mechanism, so the application can freely choose. \
There is no dependency on a particular SSL library. \
