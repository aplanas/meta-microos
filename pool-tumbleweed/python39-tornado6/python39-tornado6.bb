SUMMARY = "Open source version of scalable, non-blocking web server that power FriendFeed"
DESCRIPTION = "Tornado is an open source version of the scalable, non-blocking web server and \
tools that power FriendFeed. The FriendFeed application is written using a web \
framework that looks a bit like web.py or Google's webapp, but with additional \
tools and optimizations to take advantage of the underlying non-blocking \
infrastructure. \
 \
The framework is distinct from most mainstream web server frameworks (and \
certainly most Python frameworks) because it is non-blocking and reasonably \
fast. Because it is non-blocking and uses epoll, it can handle thousands of \
simultaneous standing connections, which means it is ideal for real-time web \
services. We built the web server specifically to handle FriendFeed's real-time \
features â€” every active user of FriendFeed maintains an open connection to the \
FriendFeed servers. (For more information on scaling servers to support \
thousands of clients, see The C10K problem.)"
