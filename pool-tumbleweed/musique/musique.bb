SUMMARY = "A different take on the music player"
DESCRIPTION = "Musique is a music player designed by and for people that love \
music. Musique does its best to stay out the way and keep you \
focused on the only thing that really matters: Music. \
You need to try it to really get it. \
To set expectations right â€” Musique is not about podcasts or \
internet radio; it's not about managing mobile devices and it has \
no integrated music store. \
It's about listening to beautiful music."
