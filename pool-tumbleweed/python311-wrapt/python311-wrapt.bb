SUMMARY = "A Python module for decorators, wrappers and monkey patching"
DESCRIPTION = "The aim of the **wrapt** module is to provide a transparent object proxy \
for Python, which can be used as the basis for the construction of function \
wrappers and decorator functions. \
 \
The **wrapt** module focuses very much on correctness. It therefore goes \
way beyond existing mechanisms such as ``functools.wraps()`` to ensure that \
decorators preserve introspectability, signatures, type checking abilities \
etc. The decorators that can be constructed using this module will work in \
far more scenarios than typical decorators and provide more predictable and \
consistent behaviour. \
 \
To ensure that the overhead is as minimal as possible, a C extension module \
is used for performance critical components. An automatic fallback to a \
pure Python implementation is also provided where a target system does not \
have a compiler to allow the C extension to be compiled. \
