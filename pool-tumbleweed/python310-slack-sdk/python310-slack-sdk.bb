SUMMARY = "Python SDKs for the Slack API"
DESCRIPTION = "The Slack platform offers several APIs to build apps. Each Slack API delivers \
part of the capabilities from the platform, so that you can pick just those \
that fit for your needs. This SDK offers a corresponding package for each of \
Slackâ€™s APIs. They are small and powerful when used independently, and work \
seamlessly when used together, too."
