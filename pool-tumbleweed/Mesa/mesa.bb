SUMMARY = "System for rendering 3-D graphics"
DESCRIPTION = "Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API which is very similar to \
that of OpenGL.* To the extent that Mesa utilizes the OpenGL command \
syntax or state machine, it is being used with authorization from \
Silicon Graphics, Inc.(SGI). However, the author does not possess an \
OpenGL license from SGI, and makes no claim that Mesa is in any way a \
compatible replacement for OpenGL or associated with SGI. Those who \
want a licensed implementation of OpenGL should contact a licensed \
vendor. \
 \
Please do not refer to the library as MesaGL (for legal reasons). It's \
just Mesa or The Mesa 3-D graphics library. \
 \
* OpenGL is a trademark of Silicon Graphics Incorporated."
