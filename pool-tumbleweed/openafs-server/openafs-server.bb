SUMMARY = "OpenAFS File System Server"
DESCRIPTION = "AFS is a cross-platform distributed file system product pioneered at \
Carnegie Mellon University and supported and developed as a product by \
Transarc Corporation (now IBM Pittsburgh Labs). It offers a \
client-server architecture for file sharing, providing location \
independence, scalability, and transparent migration capabilities for \
data. \
 \
In addition, among its features are authentication, encryption, \
caching, disconnected operations, replication for higher availability \
and load balancing, and ACLs. This package contains the static \
libraries and header files needed to develop applications for OpenAFS."
