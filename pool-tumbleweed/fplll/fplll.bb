SUMMARY = "Lenstra-Lov√°sz Lattice Basis Reduction Algorithm Library"
DESCRIPTION = "fplll contains several algorithms on lattices that rely on \
floating-point computations. This includes implementations of the \
floating-point LLL reduction algorithm, offering different \
speed/guarantees ratios. It also includes a rigorous floating-point \
implementation of the Kannan-Fincke-Pohst algorithm that finds a \
shortest non-zero lattice vector."
