SUMMARY = "Library and utility for processing cabal's plan.json file"
DESCRIPTION = "This package provides a library (see 'Cabal.Plan') for decoding 'plan.json' \
files as well as the simple tool 'cabal-plan' for extracting and pretty \
printing the information contained in the 'plan.json' file. \
 \
'plan.json' files are generated by \
[cabal](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-install)'s [Nix-style local \
builds](http://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nix-local-build.html) and contain \
detailed information about the build/install plan computed by the cabal solver. \
 \
== 'cabal-plan' utility \
 \
The 'cabal-plan' executable (enabled via the 'exe' cabal flag) provides various \
operations: \
 \
[info] Show basic report of dependency tree [show] Dump 'PlanJson' \
data-structure via 'Show' instance [tred] Show dependency tree as a graph \
[diff] Diff two install plans [list-bins] List all binaries [list-bin] List \
single binary (useful for scripting, e.g. 'cabal list-bin exe:cabal-plan') \
[fingerprint] Print SHA256 sums of dependencies' source tarballs and cabal \
files [dot] Generate graph of dependencies in '.dot' format [topo] Print plan \
topologically sorted [license-report] Generate license report for a component \
(only available when built with 'license-report' flag enabled); see \
<src/example/cabal-plan.md report example for cabal-plan> \
(<src/example/cabal-plan.html Pandoc rendered HTML>) \
 \
See also ['New things in Haskell package QA' \
Blogpost](https://oleg.fi/gists/posts/2018-01-08-haskell-package-qa.html) for a \
description of the 'topo' and 'dot' operations as well as how to enable \
tab-completion."
