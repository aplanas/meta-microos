SUMMARY = "OpenAFS authentication shared libraries"
DESCRIPTION = "The AFS distributed filesystem.  AFS is a distributed filesystem \
allowing cross-platform sharing of files among multiple computers. \
Facilities are provided for access control, authentication, backup and \
administrative management. \
 \
This package provides a shared version of libafsrpc and libafsauthent. \
None of the programs included with OpenAFS currently use these shared \
libraries; however, third-party software that wishes to perform AFS \
authentication may link against them."
