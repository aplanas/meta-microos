DESCRIPTION = "Alpine is a display-oriented email client that is suitable for both \
the inexperienced email user as well as for the most demanding of \
power users. Alpine is based on the PineÂ® Message System, which was \
also developed at the University of Washington. Alpine can be learned \
by exploration and the use of context-sensitive help. The user \
experience is highly customizable through the use of the Alpine Setup \
command."
