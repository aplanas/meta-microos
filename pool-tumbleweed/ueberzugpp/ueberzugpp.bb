SUMMARY = "Utility to render images in terminals"
DESCRIPTION = "Überzug++ is a C++ command line utility which allows to draw images \
on terminals by using child windows or using sixel on supported \
terminals. (This is a drop-in replacement for the now defunct \
ueberzug project.) \
 \
Advantages over w3mimgdisplay and ueberzug: \
 \
- support for wayland (sway only) \
- no race conditions as a new window is created to display images \
- 'expose' events will be processed, so that images will be \
  redrawn when switching workspaces \
- tmux support on X11 \
- terminals without the WINDOWID environment variable are supported \
- chars are used as position and size unit \
- A lot of image formats are supported (through opencv and libvips) \
- GIF and animated WEBP support on X11 and Sixel \
- Resized images are cached for faster viewing"
