SUMMARY = "Create generic methods for OO Perl"
DESCRIPTION = "This module solves the problem of having to continually write accessor \
methods for your objects that perform standard tasks. \
 \
The argument to 'use' is an *arrayref*, as pairs whose 'keys' are the names \
of types of generic methods generated by MethodMaker and whose 'values' \
tell method maker what methods to make. \
 \
To override any generated methods, it is sufficient to ensure that the \
overriding method is defined when Class::MethodMaker is called. Note that \
the 'use' keyword introduces a 'BEGIN' block, so you may need to define (or \
at least declare) your overriding method in a 'BEGIN' block."
