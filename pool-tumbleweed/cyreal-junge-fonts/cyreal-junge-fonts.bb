SUMMARY = "Junge Font"
DESCRIPTION = "Junge is an elegant and slim text typeface inspired by the calligraphy \
of GÃ¼nther Junge. Thanks to a combination of features it performs \
equally well in most ranges. At small sizes it builds the impression of \
flittering strokes. In large headlines its refined detailing become \
visible. It is not as strictly structured as a text typeface, and has \
subtle irregularities reminiscent of its calligraphic origin."
