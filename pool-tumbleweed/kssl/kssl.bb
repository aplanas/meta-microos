SUMMARY = "Code and utilities to ease the transition to KDE Frameworks 5"
DESCRIPTION = "This package includes CMake macros and C++ \
classes whose functionality has been replaced by code in CMake, Qt and \
other frameworks. \
 \
Code should aim to port away from this framework eventually.  The API \
documentation of the classes in this framework and the notes at \
<https://community.kde.org/Frameworks/Porting_Notes> should help with \
this. \
 \
Note that some of the classes in this framework, especially \
KStandardDirs, may not work correctly unless any libraries and other \
software using the KDE4 Support framework are installed to the same \
location as KDELibs4Support, although it may be sufficient to set the \
KDEDIRS environment variable correctly."
