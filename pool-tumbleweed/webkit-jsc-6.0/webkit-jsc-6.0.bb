SUMMARY = "JavaScript command line from WebKit"
DESCRIPTION = "jsc is a command-line utility that allows you to run JavaScript \
programs outside of the context of a web browser. It is primarily \
used as part of the test harness for validating the JavaScript \
portions of WebKit, but can also be used as a scripting tool. \
 \
jsc can be run in an interactive mode to test out JavaScript \
expressions, or it can be passed one or more files to run similar to \
invoking a Perl or Python script."
