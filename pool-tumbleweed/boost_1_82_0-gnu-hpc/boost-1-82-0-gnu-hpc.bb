SUMMARY = "Boost C++ Libraries"
DESCRIPTION = "Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries. The \
emphasis is on libraries that work well with the C++ Standard Library. \
One goal is to establish 'existing practice' and provide reference \
implementations so that the Boost libraries are suitable for eventual \
standardization. Some of the libraries have already been proposed for \
inclusion in the C++ Standards Committee's upcoming C++ Standard \
Library Technical Report. \
 \
Although Boost was begun by members of the C++ Standards Committee \
Library Working Group, membership has expanded to include nearly two \
thousand members of the C++ community at large."
