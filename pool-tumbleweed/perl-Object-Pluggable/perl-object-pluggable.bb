SUMMARY = "Base Class for Creating Plugin-Enabled Objects"
DESCRIPTION = "Object::Pluggable is a base class for creating plugin enabled objects. It \
is a generic port of POE::Component::IRC's plugin system. \
 \
If your object dispatches events to listeners, then Object::Pluggable may \
be a good fit for you. \
 \
Basic use would involve subclassing Object::Pluggable, then overriding \
'_pluggable_event()' and inserting '_pluggable_process()' wherever you \
dispatch events from. \
 \
Users of your object can then load plugins using the plugin methods \
provided to handle events generated by the object. \
 \
You may also use plugin style handlers within your object as \
'_pluggable_process()' will attempt to process any events with local method \
calls first. The return value of these handlers has the same significance \
as the return value of 'normal' plugin handlers."
