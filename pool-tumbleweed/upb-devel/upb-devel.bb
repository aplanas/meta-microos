SUMMARY = "Developmnt files for upb"
DESCRIPTION = "Î¼pb (often written 'upb') is a small protobuf implementation written in C. \
 \
upb generates a C API for creating, parsing, and serializing messages as \
declared in .proto files. upb is heavily arena-based: all messages always live \
in an arena (note: the arena can live in stack or static memory if desired). \
 \
This package provides development files for upb."
