SUMMARY = "Command-line interface for the hledger accounting system"
DESCRIPTION = "The command-line interface for the hledger accounting system. Its basic \
function is to read a plain text file describing financial transactions and \
produce useful reports. \
 \
hledger is a robust, cross-platform set of tools for tracking money, time, or \
any other commodity, using double-entry accounting and a simple, editable file \
format, with command-line, terminal and web interfaces. It is a Haskell rewrite \
of Ledger, and one of the leading implementations of Plain Text Accounting. \
