SUMMARY = "Header files of tensorflow"
DESCRIPTION = "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. \
The Tensorflow Lite package is a fraction the size of the full tensorflow package \
and includes the bare minimum code required to run inferences with TensorFlow Lite \
 â€” primarily the Interpreter Python class. This small package is for when all you \
want to do is execute .tflite models and avoid wasting disk space with the large \
TensorFlow library. \
 \
This package provides necessary headers for the C/C++ Api using TensorFlow Lite. \
As well as the static libtensorflow-lite.a for use in your own projects without the \
Python interpreter."
