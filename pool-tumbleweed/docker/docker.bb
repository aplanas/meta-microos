SUMMARY = "The Moby-project Linux container runtime"
DESCRIPTION = "Docker complements LXC with a high-level API which operates at the process \
level. It runs unix processes with strong guarantees of isolation and \
repeatability across servers. \
 \
Docker is a great building block for automating distributed systems: large-scale \
web deployments, database clusters, continuous deployment systems, private PaaS, \
service-oriented architectures, etc."
