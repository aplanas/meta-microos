SUMMARY = "Kernel crash dump scripts and utilities"
DESCRIPTION = "kdump is a package that includes several scripts for kdump, including \
the kdump service and configuration files \
 \
The kernel package and this package are all that are required for a \
crash dump to occur. However, if you wish to debug the crash dump \
yourself you will need several debugging packages installed for each \
kernel flavor and release you wish to debug. \
 \
For example, if you are debugging kernel-default, you will need: \
- kernel-default-debuginfo \
- kernel-default-devel \
- kernel-default-devel-debuginfo \
 \
These packages are not needed to create the dump and can be installed \
after a crash dump has occured."
