SUMMARY = "Font using Twitterâ€™s color emoji"
DESCRIPTION = "A color and monochrome emoji SVG-in-OpenType font built from the \
Twitter Emoji for Everyone artwork with support for ZWJ, \
skin tone diversity and country flags. \
 \
The font works in all operating systems, but will currently only \
show color emoji in Firefox, Thunderbird and other Mozilla Gecko-based \
applications. This is not a limitation of the font but of the \
operating systems and applications. Regular monochrome outline \
emoji are included for backwards/fallback compatibility."
