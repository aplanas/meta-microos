SUMMARY = "Library providing a virtualization API"
DESCRIPTION = "Libvirt is a C toolkit to interact with the virtualization \
capabilities of Linux. Virtualization of the Linux Operating System means \
the ability to run multiple instances of Operating Systems concurrently \
on a single hardware system where the basic resources are driven by a \
Linux instance. The library aims to provide long term stable C API \
to interact with Linux virtualization technologies."
