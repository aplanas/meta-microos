SUMMARY = "Py.test plugin to store test expectations and mark tests based on them"
DESCRIPTION = "A py.test plugin that stores test expectations by saving the set of \
failing tests, allowing them to be marked as xfail when running them \
in future. The tests expectations are stored such that they can be \
distributed alongside the tests. However, note that test expectations \
can only be reliably shared between Python 2 and Python 3 if they only \
use ASCII characters in their node ids: this likely isnâ€™t a limitation \
if tests are using the normal Python format, as Python 2 only allows \
ASCII characters in identifiers."
