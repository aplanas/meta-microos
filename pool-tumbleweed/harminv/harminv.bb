SUMMARY = "Solver for the problem of harmonic inversion"
DESCRIPTION = "Harminv is a program to solve the problem of harmonic inversion â€” given \
a discrete-time, finite-length signal that consists of a sum of \
finitely-many sinusoids (possibly exponentially decaying) in a given \
bandwidth, it determines the frequencies, decay constants, amplitudes, \
and phases of those sinusoids."
