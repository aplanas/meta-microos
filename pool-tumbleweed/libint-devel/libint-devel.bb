SUMMARY = "Development headers and libraries for libint"
DESCRIPTION = "LIBINT computes the Coulomb and exchange integrals, which in electronic \
structure theory are called electron repulsion integrals (ERIs). This is by \
far the most common type of integrals in molecular structure theory. \
 \
LIBINT uses recursive schemes that originate in seminal Obara-Saika method and \
Head-Gordon and Popleâ€™s variation thereof. The idea of LIBINT is to optimize \
computer implementation of such methods by implementing an optimizing compiler \
to generate automatically highly-specialized code that runs well on \
super-scalar architectures. \
 \
This package contains development headers and libraries for libint."
