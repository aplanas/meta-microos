SUMMARY = "VDE ecryption module"
DESCRIPTION = "slirpvde is a slirp interface for a VDE network. \
Slirpvde  connects  all  the units (virtual or real machines) to the network \
of the host where slirpvde runs as it were a NAT/Masquerading router. \
The default route is the node 2 (10.0.2.2 in the default  network  configuration) \
and DNS is re-mapped in node 3 (10.0.2.3). \
 \
Slirpvde  runs  using  standard user privileges (no need for root access): \
all the connections are re-generated by slirpvde itself. \
 \
IPv4 only. IPv6 is still unsupported (will be supported when slirpvde \
will be rewritten using the  LWIPv6  network stack)."
