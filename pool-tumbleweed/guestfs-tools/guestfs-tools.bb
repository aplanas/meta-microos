SUMMARY = "Tools to access and modify virtual machine disk images"
DESCRIPTION = "guestfs-tools is a set of tools that can be used to make batch \
configuration changes to guests, get disk used/free statistics \
(virt-df), perform backups and guest clones, change \
registry/UUID/hostname info, build guests from scratch (virt-builder) \
and much more. \
 \
Virt-alignment-scan scans virtual machines looking for partition \
alignment problems. \
 \
Virt-builder is a command line tool for rapidly making disk images \
of popular free operating systems. \
 \
Virt-cat is a command line tool to display the contents of a file in a \
virtual machine. \
 \
Virt-customize is a command line tool for customizing virtual machine \
disk images. \
 \
Virt-df is a command line tool to display free space on virtual \
machine filesystems.  Unlike other tools, it doesnâ€™t just display the \
amount of space allocated to a virtual machine, but can look inside \
the virtual machine to see how much space is really being used.  It is \
like the df(1) command, but for virtual machines, except that it also \
works for Windows virtual machines. \
 \
Virt-diff shows the differences between virtual machines. \
 \
Virt-edit is a command line tool to edit the contents of a file in a \
virtual machine. \
 \
Virt-filesystems is a command line tool to display the filesystems, \
partitions, block devices, LVs, VGs and PVs found in a disk image \
or virtual machine.  It replaces the deprecated programs \
virt-list-filesystems and virt-list-partitions with a much more \
capable tool. \
 \
Virt-format is a command line tool to erase and make blank disks. \
 \
Virt-get-kernel extracts a kernel/initrd from a disk image. \
 \
Virt-inspector examines a virtual machine and tries to determine the \
version of the OS, the kernel version, what drivers are installed, \
whether the virtual machine is fully virtualized (FV) or \
para-virtualized (PV), what applications are installed and more. \
 \
Virt-log is a command line tool to display the log files from a \
virtual machine. \
 \
Virt-ls is a command line tool to list out files in a virtual machine. \
 \
Virt-make-fs is a command line tool to build a filesystem out of \
a collection of files or a tarball. \
 \
Virt-resize can resize existing virtual machine disk images. \
 \
Virt-sparsify makes virtual machine disk images sparse (thin-provisioned). \
 \
Virt-sysprep lets you reset or unconfigure virtual machines in \
preparation for cloning them. \
 \
Virt-tail follows (tails) a log file within a guest, like 'tail -f'."
