Salt-lint \
========= \
 \
``salt-lint`` checks Salt state files (SLS) for practices and behavior that could potentially be improved. \
 \
The project is heavily based on `ansible-lint`_, which was created by `Will Thames`_ and is now maintained as part of the `Ansible`_ by `Red Hat`_ project. \
 \
Installing \
========== \
 \
Using Pip \
--------- \
 \
.. code-block:: bash \
 \
    pip install salt-lint \
 \
From Source \
----------- \
 \
.. code-block:: bash \
 \
    pip install git+https://github.com/roaldnefs/salt-lint.git \
 \
Usage \
===== \
 \
Command Line Options \
-------------------- \
 \
The following is the output from ``salt-lint --help``, providing an overview of the basic command line options: \
 \
.. code-block:: bash \
 \
   Usage: salt-lint [options] init.sls [state ...] \
 \
   Options: \
     --version             show program's version number and exit \
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit \
     -L                    list all the rules \
     -r RULESDIR           specify one or more rules directories using one or \
                           more -r arguments. Any -r flags override the default \
                           rules in /tmp/saltlint/lib/saltlint/rules, unless -R \
                           is also used. \
     -R                    Use default rules in /tmp/saltlint/lib/saltlint/rules \
                           in addition to any extra rules directories specified \
                           with -r. There is no need to specify this if no -r \
                           flags are used. \
     -t TAGS               only check rules whose id/tags match these values \
     -T                    list all the tags \
     -v                    Increase verbosity level \
     -x SKIP_LIST          only check rules whose id/tags do not match these \
                           values \
     --nocolor             disable colored output \
     --force-color         Try force colored output (relying on salt's code) \
     --exclude=EXCLUDE_PATHS \
                           path to directories or files to skip. This option is \
                           repeatable. \
     -c C                  Specify configuration file to use.  Defaults to \
                           '.salt-lint' \
 \
Linting Salt state files \
------------------------ \
 \
It's important to note that ``salt-lint`` accepts a list of Salt state files or a list of directories. \
 \
GitHub Action \
------------- \
 \
Salt-lint is available on the GitHub `marketplace`_ as a GitHub Action. The `salt-lint-action`_ allows you to run ``salt-lint`` with no additional options. \
 \
To use the action simply add the following lines to your ``.github/workflows/main.yml``. \
 \
.. code-block:: yaml \
 \
    on: [push] \
 \
    jobs: \
      test: \
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest \
        name: Salt Lint Action \
        steps: \
        - uses: actions/checkout@v1 \
        - name: Run salt-lint \
          uses: roaldnefs/salt-lint-action@master \
          env: \
            ACTION_STATE_NAME: init.sls \
 \
Configuring \
=========== \
 \
Configuration File \
------------------ \
 \
Salt-lint supports local configuration via a ``.salt-lint`` configuration file. Salt-lint checks the working directory for the presence of this file and applies any configuration found there. The configuration file location can also be overridden via the ``-c path/to/file`` CLI flag. \
 \
If a value is provided on both the command line and via a configuration file, the values will be merged (if a list like **exclude_paths**), or the **True** value will be preferred, in the case of something like **quiet**. \
 \
The following values are supported, and function identically to their CLI counterparts: \
 \
.. code-block:: yaml \
 \
    --- \
    exclude_paths: \
      - exclude_this_file \
      - exclude_this_directory/ \
      - exclude/this/sub-directory/ \
    skip_list: \
      - 207 \
      - 208 \
    tags: \
      - formatting \
    verbosity: 1 \
 \
Pre-commit Setup \
---------------- \
 \
To use salt-lint with `pre-commit`_,  just add the following to your local repo's ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` file. Prior to version 0.12.0 of `pre-commit`_ the file was ``hooks.yaml`` (now ``.pre-commit-config.yaml``). \
 \
.. code-block:: yaml \
 \
    --- \
 \
     \
     \
 \
    -   id: salt-lint \
        name: Salt-lint \
        description: This hook runs salt-lint. \
        entry: salt-lint \
        language: python \
        files: \\.(sls)$ \
 \
Rules \
===== \
 \
False Positives: Skipping Rules \
------------------------------- \
 \
Some rules are bit of a rule of thumb. To skip a specific rule for a specific task, inside your state add ``# noqa [rule_id]`` at the end of the line. You can skip multiple rules via a space-separated list. Example: \
 \
.. code-block:: yaml \
 \
    /tmp/testfile: \
      file.managed: \
        - source: salt://{{unspaced_var}}/example  # noqa: 206 \
