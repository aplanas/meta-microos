SUMMARY = "Singular CAS"
DESCRIPTION = "Singular is a computer algebra system for polynomial computations, \
with special emphasis on commutative and non-commutative algebra, \
algebraic geometry, and singularity theory. \
 \
Its main computational objects are ideals, modules and matrices over \
a large number of baserings. These include \
 \
* polynomial rings over various ground fields and some rings \
  (including the integers), \
* localizations of the above, \
* a general class of non-commutative algebras (including the exterior \
  algebra and the Weyl algebra), \
* quotient rings of the above, \
* tensor products of the above. \
 \
Singular's core algorithms handle \
 \
* Gr√∂bner resp. standard bases and free resolutions, \
* polynomial factorization, \
* resultants, characteristic sets, and numerical root finding."
