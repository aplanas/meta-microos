SUMMARY = "A framework used for deep learning for mobile and embedded devices"
DESCRIPTION = "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. \
The Tensorflow Lite package is a fraction the size of the full tensorflow package \
and includes the bare minimum code required to run inferences with TensorFlow Lite \
 â€” primarily the Interpreter Python class. This small package is for when all you \
want to do is execute .tflite models and avoid wasting disk space with the large \
TensorFlow library."
