SUMMARY = "The PEP 517 compliant PyQt build system"
DESCRIPTION = "PyQt-builder is the PEP 517 compliant build system for PyQt and projects that \
extend PyQt. It extends the sip build system and uses Qtâ€™s qmake to perform the \
actual compilation and installation of extension modules. \
 \
Projects that use PyQt-builder provide an appropriate pyproject.toml file and an \
optional project.py script. Any PEP 517 compliant frontend, for example \
sip-install or pip can then be used to build and install the project."
