SUMMARY = "Fast, pure and practical MD5 implementation"
DESCRIPTION = "A practical incremental and one-pass, pure API to the \
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5 MD5 hash algorithm> (including \
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC HMAC> support) with performance close to \
the fastest implementations available in other languages. \
 \
The implementation is made in C with a haskell FFI wrapper that hides the C \
implementation. \
 \
NOTE: This package has been forked off 'cryptohash-0.11.7' because the \
'cryptohash' package has been deprecated and so this package continues to \
satisfy the need for a lightweight package providing the MD5 hash algorithm \
without any dependencies on packages other than 'base' and 'bytestring'. \
 \
Consequently, this package can be used as a drop-in replacement for \
'cryptohash''s 'Crypto.Hash.MD5' module, though with a clearly smaller \
footprint."
