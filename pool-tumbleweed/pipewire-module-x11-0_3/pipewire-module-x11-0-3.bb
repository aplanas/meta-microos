 \
The framework is used to build a modular daemon that can be configured to: \
 \
 * Be a low-latency audio server with features like pulseaudio and/or jack; \
 * A video capture server that can manage hardware video capture devices \
   and provide access to them; \
 * A central hub where video can be made available for other applications \
   such as the gnome-shell screencast API. \
 \
