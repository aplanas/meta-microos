SUMMARY = "An end-user CLI for the Bitcoin crypto-currency"
DESCRIPTION = "Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system \
that is completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or \
trusted parties. Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and \
transact directly with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check \
for double-spending. \
 \
Full transaction history is stored locally at each client. This requires \
several GB of space, slowly growing. \
 \
This package provides bitcoin-cli â€” a CLI tool to interact with the daemon."
