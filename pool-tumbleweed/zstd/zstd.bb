SUMMARY = "Zstandard compression tools"
DESCRIPTION = "Zstd, short for Zstandard, is a lossless compression algorithm. Speed \
vs. compression trade-off is configurable in small increments. \
Decompression speed is preserved and remains roughly the same at all \
settings, a property shared by most LZ compression algorithms, such \
as zlib or lzma. \
 \
At roughly the same ratio, zstd (v1.4.0) achieves ~870% faster \
compression than gzip. For roughly the same time, zstd achives a \
~12% better ratio than gzip. LZMA outperforms zstd by ~10% faster \
compression for same ratio, or ~1â€“4% size reduction for same time."
