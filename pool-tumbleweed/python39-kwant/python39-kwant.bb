SUMMARY = "Python library for numerical quantum transport calculations"
DESCRIPTION = "Kwant is a Python library for numerical calculations on tight-binding \
models with a strong focus on quantum transport. Kwant can be used to \
simulate a variety of systems and phenomena in quantum physics \
including: metals, graphene, topological insulators, quantum Hall \
effect, superconductivity, spintronics, molecular electronics, any \
combination of the above, and many other things. Kwant can calculate \
transport properties (conductance, noise, scattering matrix), \
dispersion relations, modes, wave functions, various Greenâ€™s \
functions, out-of-equilibrium local quantities."
