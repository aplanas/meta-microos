SUMMARY = "System Clock Synchronization Client and Server"
DESCRIPTION = "Chrony is an implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP). It can \
synchronize the system clock with NTP servers, reference clocks (e.g. a \
GPS receiver), and manual input using wristwatch and keyboard. It can \
also operate as an NTPv4 (RFC 5905) server and peer to provide a time \
service to other computers in the network. \
 \
Chrony consists of two programs: chronyd and chronyc. \
 \
Chronyd is a daemon which runs in the background on the system. It \
obtains measurements of the system clockâ€™s offset relative to time \
servers on other systems via the network and adjusts the system time \
accordingly. For isolated systems, the user can periodically enter the \
correct time by hand (using chronyc). In either case, chronyd \
determines the rate at which the computer gains or loses time, and \
compensates for this. Chronyd can act as either a client or a server. \
 \
Chronyc provides a user interface to chronyd for monitoring its \
performance and configuring various settings. It can do so while \
running on the same computer as the chronyd instance it is controlling \
or a different computer."
