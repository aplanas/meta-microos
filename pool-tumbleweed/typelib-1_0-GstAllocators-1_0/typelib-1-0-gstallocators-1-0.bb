SUMMARY = "GStreamer Streaming-Media Framework Plug-Ins -- Introspection bindings"
DESCRIPTION = "GStreamer is a streaming media framework based on graphs of filters \
that operate on media data. Applications using this library can do \
anything media-related, from real-time sound processing to playing \
videos. Its plug-in-based architecture means that new data types or \
processing capabilities can be added simply by installing new plug-ins. \
 \
This package provides the GObject Introspection bindings for GStreamer \
plug-ins."
