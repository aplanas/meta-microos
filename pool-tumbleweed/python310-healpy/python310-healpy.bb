SUMMARY = "Python library to handle pixelated data on the sphere based on HEALPix"
DESCRIPTION = "healpy is a Python package to handle pixelated data on the sphere. It is based \
on the Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization (HEALPix) scheme and \
bundles the HEALPix C++ library. \
 \
healpy provides utilities to: \
* convert between sky coordinates and pixel indices in HEALPix nested and ring schemes \
* find pixels within a disk, a polygon or a strip in the sky \
* apply coordinate transformations between Galactic, Ecliptic and Equatorial reference frames \
* apply custom rotations either to vectors or full maps \
* read and write HEALPix maps to disk in FITS format \
* upgrade and downgrade the resolution of existing HEALPix maps \
* visualize maps in Mollweide, Gnomonic and Cartographic projections \
* transform maps to Spherical Harmonics space and back using multi-threaded C++ routines \
* compute Auto and Cross Power Spectra from maps and create map realizations from spectra"
