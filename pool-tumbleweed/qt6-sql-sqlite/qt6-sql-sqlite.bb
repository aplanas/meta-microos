SUMMARY = "Qt 6 SQLite plugin"
DESCRIPTION = "A plugin to access SQLite databases in Qt applications. \
 \
SQLite is an in-process database, which means that it is not \
necessary to have a database server. SQLite operates on a single \
file, which must be set as the database name when opening a \
connection."
