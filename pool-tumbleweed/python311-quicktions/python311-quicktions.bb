SUMMARY = "Fast fractions data type for rational numbers"
DESCRIPTION = "Python's Fraction data type is an excellent way to do exact money \
calculations and largely beats Decimal in terms of simplicity, \
accuracy and safety.  Clearly not in terms of speed, though, given \
the cdecimal accelerator in Py3.3+. \
 \
Quicktions is an adaptation of the original fractions module \
(as included in CPython 3.5) that is compiled and optimised with \
Cython into a fast, native extension module. \
 \
Compared to the standard library fractions module in Py2.7 and \
Py3.4, quicktions is currently about 10x faster, and still about \
6x faster than the current version in Python 3.5.  It's also about \
15x faster than the (Python implemented) decimal module in Py2.7."
