SUMMARY = "Static website generator written in Go"
DESCRIPTION = "Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go. It is optimized \
for speed, ease of use, and configurability, and designed to work well for any \
kind of website including blogs, tumbles, and docs. Hugo takes a directory with \
Markdown and templates and renders them into a full HTML website, typically in a \
fraction of a second. You can run Hugo from any directory, which works well for \
shared hosts and other systems where you donâ€™t have a privileged account. Hugo \
provides a Privacy Config that can assist with General Data Protection \
Regulation (GDPR) compliance issues. \
