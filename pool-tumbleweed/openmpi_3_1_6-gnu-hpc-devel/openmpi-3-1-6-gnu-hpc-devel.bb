SUMMARY = "SDK for openMPI HPC version 3.1.6"
DESCRIPTION = "OpenMPI is an implementation of the Message Passing Interface, a \
standardized API typically used for parallel and/or distributed \
computing. OpenMPI is the merged result of four prior implementations \
where the team found for them to excel in one or more areas, \
such as latency or throughput. \
 \
OpenMPI also includes an implementation of the OpenSHMEM parallel \
programming API, which is a Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) \
abstraction layer providing inter-process communication using \
one-sided communication techniques. \
 \
This subpackage provides the development files for Open MPI/OpenSHMEM, \
such as wrapper compilers and header files for MPI/OpenSHMEM \
development."
