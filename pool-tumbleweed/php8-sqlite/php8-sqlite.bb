SUMMARY = "SQLite database client for PHP"
DESCRIPTION = "This is an extension for the SQLite Embeddable SQL Database Engine. \
https://www.sqlite.org \
 \
SQLite is a C library that implements an embeddable SQL database \
engine. Programs that link with the SQLite library can have SQL \
database access without running a separate RDBMS process. \
 \
SQLite is not a client library used to connect to a big database \
server. SQLite is the server. The SQLite library reads and writes \
directly to and from the database files on disk. \
 \
This package includes sqlite and pdo_sqlite modules for sqlite version \
2 and 3 respectively."
