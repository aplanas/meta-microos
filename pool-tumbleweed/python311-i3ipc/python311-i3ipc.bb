SUMMARY = "Python library for i3 WM extensions"
DESCRIPTION = "python-i3ipc is a Python library for controlling the i3 window manager which \
aims to be used by scripts and applications which interact with the window \
manager like status line generators, notification daemons and pagers. \
 \
This library uses i3â€™s interprocess communication, which is the interface \
that i3 WM uses to receive commands from client applications such as i3-msg. It \
also features a publish/subscribe mechanism for notifying interested parties of \
window manager events."
