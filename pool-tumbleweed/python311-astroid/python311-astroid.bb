SUMMARY = "Representation of Python source as an AST for pylint"
DESCRIPTION = "This module provides a common base representation of Python source code for \
projects such as pychecker, pyreverse, pylint. The development of this library \
is governed by pylint's needs. \
 \
It provides a compatible representation which comes from the _ast \
module. It rebuilds the tree generated by the builtin _ast module by \
recursively walking down the AST and building an extended ast. The new \
node classes have additional methods and attributes for different \
usages. They include some support for static inference and local name \
scopes. Furthermore, astroid builds partial trees by inspecting living \
objects."
