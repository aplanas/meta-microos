SUMMARY = "Test programs and examples for mumps"
DESCRIPTION = "MUMPS implements a direct solver for large sparse linear systems, with a \
particular focus on symmetric positive definite matrices.  It can \
operate on distributed matrices e.g. over a cluster.  It has Fortran and \
C interfaces, and can interface with ordering tools such as Scotch. \
 \
This packages contains some test and examples programs for mumps. In addition, \
matlab and scilab extensions are provided in /usr/share/doc/packages/mumps."
