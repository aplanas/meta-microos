SUMMARY = "Low-level networking interface"
DESCRIPTION = "This package provides a low-level networking interface. \
 \
=== High-Level Packages Other packages provide higher level interfaces: \
 \
* connection * hookup * network-simple \
 \
=== Extended Packages 'network' seeks to provide a cross-platform core for \
networking. As such some APIs live in extended libraries. Packages in the \
'network' ecosystem are often prefixed with 'network-'. \
 \
==== 'network-bsd' In 'network-3.0.0.0' the 'Network.BSD' module was split off \
into its own package, 'network-bsd-3.0.0.0'. \
 \
==== 'network-uri' In 'network-2.6' the 'Network.URI' module was split off into \
its own package, 'network-uri-2.6'. If you're using the 'Network.URI' module \
you can automatically get it from the right package by adding this to your \
'.cabal' file: \
 \
> library > build-depends: network-uri-flag."
