SUMMARY = "The GNU versions of find utilities (find and xargs)"
DESCRIPTION = "The findutils package contains programs which will help you locate \
files on your system.  The find utility searches through a hierarchy \
of directories looking for files which match a certain set of criteria \
(such as a file name pattern).  The xargs utility builds and executes \
command lines from standard input arguments (usually lists of file \
names generated by the find command). \
 \
You should install findutils because it includes tools that are very \
useful for finding things on your system."
