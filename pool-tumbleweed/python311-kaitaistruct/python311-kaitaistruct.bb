SUMMARY = "Python library for kaitaistruct"
DESCRIPTION = "This library implements the Kaitai Struct API for Python. \
 \
Kaitai Struct is a declarative language used to describe various binary data \
structures, laid out in files or in memory: i.e. binary file formats, network \
stream packet formats, etc. \
 \
It is similar to Pythonâ€™s [construct] and [Construct3], but it is \
language-agnostic. \
The format description is done in YAML-based .ksy format, which then can be \
compiled into a wide range of target languages."
