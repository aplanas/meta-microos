SUMMARY = "A graphical frontend for 'xmodmap'"
DESCRIPTION = "'xkeycaps' is a graphical front-end to 'xmodmap'. It opens a window \
that looks like a keyboard. Moving the mouse over a key shows what \
KeySyms and Modifier bits that key generates. Clicking on a key \
simulates KeyPress/KeyRelease events on the window of your choice. It \
is possible to change the KeySyms and Modifiers generated by a key \
through a mouse-based interface. This program can also write an input \
file for xmodmap to recreate your changes in future sessions. \
