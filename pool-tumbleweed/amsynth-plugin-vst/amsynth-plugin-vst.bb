SUMMARY = "Analog modelling (a.k.a virtual analog) software synthesizer"
DESCRIPTION = "Amsynth is an analog modelling (a.k.a virtual analog) software synthesizer. \
It mimics the operation of early analog subtractive synthesizers with \
classic oscillator waveforms, envelopes, filter, modulation and effects. \
The aim is to make it easy to create and modify sounds. \
 \
Features: \
 * Dual oscillators (sine / saw / square / noise) with hard sync \
 * 12/24 dB/oct resonant filter (low-pass / high-pass / band-pass / notch) \
 * Mono / poly / legato keyboard modes \
 * Dual ADSR envelope generators (filter & amplitude) \
 * LFO which can modulate the oscillators, filter, and amplitude \
 * Distortion and reverb \
 * Hundreds of presets \
 \
There are currently several different ways to run amsynth: \
 * Stand-alone application using JACK, ALSA or OSS \
 * DSSI plug-in \
 * LV2 plug-in \
 * VST plug-in \
 \
This package includes the VST implementation of the synthesizer."
