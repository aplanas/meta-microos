SUMMARY = "Compressor with Burrowsâ€“Wheeler transform and PPM context modeling"
DESCRIPTION = "A compressor featuring improved compression ratios and performance \
over bzip2 thanks to a order-0 context mixing entropy coder, a \
Burrows-Wheeler transform code making use of suffix arrays, a RLE \
with Lempel Ziv+Prediction pass based on LZ77-style string matching \
and PPM-style context modeling. \
 \
bzip3 1.3.0 can outperform zstd 1.5.5 on specific data sets, e.g. \
15% better ratio for same compress time on source code, but has \
time trouble with e.g. object files."
