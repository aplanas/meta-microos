SUMMARY = "Qt 6 Concurrent library"
DESCRIPTION = "The QtConcurrent namespace provides high-level APIs that help write \
multi-threaded programs without using low-level threading primitives \
such as mutexes, read-write locks, wait conditions, or semaphores. \
Programs written with QtConcurrent automatically adjust the number of \
threads used according to the number of processor cores available. \
 \
QtConcurrent includes functional programming style APIs for parallel \
list processing, including a MapReduce and FilterReduce \
implementation for shared-memory (non-distributed) systems, and \
classes for managing asynchronous computations in GUI applications."
