SUMMARY = "Read resources from Python packages"
DESCRIPTION = "importlib_resources is a backport of Python standard library \
importlib.resources module for older Pythons. Users of Python 3.9 and \
beyond should use the standard library module, since for these versions, \
importlib_resources just delegates to that module. \
 \
The key goal of this module is to replace parts of pkg_resources with a \
solution in Pythonâ€™s stdlib that relies on well-defined APIs. This makes \
reading resources included in packages easier, with more stable and \
consistent semantics."
