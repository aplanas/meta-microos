SUMMARY = "Character encoding aliases for legacy web content"
DESCRIPTION = "This is a Python implementation of the WHATWG Encoding standard. \
 \
In order to be compatible with legacy web content when interpreting \
something like Content-Type: text/html; charset=latin1, tools need to \
use a particular set of aliases for encoding labels as well as some \
overriding rules. For example, US-ASCII and iso-8859-1 on the web are \
actually aliases for windows-1252, and an UTF-8 or UTF-16 BOM takes \
precedence over any other encoding declaration. The Encoding standard \
defines all such details so that implementations do not have to \
reverse-engineer each other. \
 \
This module has encoding labels and BOM detection, but the actual \
implementation for encoders and decoders is Pythonâ€™s."
