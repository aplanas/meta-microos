SUMMARY = "Elegant sans-serif Typeface Family"
DESCRIPTION = "Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface, designed by Matt McInerney, \
initially in a single Thin weight. It is a display face that features \
both old style and lining numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, \
a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as stylistic alternates \
inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than it's neo-grotesque \
inspired default character set. \
 \
The Impallariâ€“Fuenzalida derivative extends the Raleway font family \
into a full set of 9 weights with true italics and expanded character \
set support for all 104 Latin languages."
