SUMMARY = "Marmelad Cyrillic Font"
DESCRIPTION = "Marmelad is designed specifically for medium to large-size headlines and \
remains well-balanced for long text setting because of its regular \
proportions and medium contrast. Ascenders and descenders are elegant \
and details refined. The name and overall feel refers to marmalade \
sweets â€“ soft and ductile. \
 \
All vertical strokes are rounded towards the baseline, which is why \
technically there is no sense for overshoots in rounded letters like O. \
Marmelad performs well on screen because of its soft rounded features \
and generous x-height. \
 \
The font supports Latin-1, Cyrillic and Turkish (Latin-5) encoding."
