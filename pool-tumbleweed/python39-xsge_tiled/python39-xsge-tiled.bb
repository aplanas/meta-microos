SUMMARY = "xSGE Tiled Library"
DESCRIPTION = "xSGE is a collection of extensions for the SGE licensed under the GNU \
General Public License.  They are designed to give additional features \
to free/libre software games which aren't necessary, but are nice to \
have. \
 \
xSGE extensions are not dependent on any particular SGE implementation. \
They should work with any implementation that follows the specification. \
 \
This extension provides support for loading the JSON format of the \
Tiled Map Editor. This allows you to use Tiled to edit your gameâ€™s world \
(e.g. levels), rather than building a level editor yourself."
