SUMMARY = "Check operability of computer hardware and find drivers"
DESCRIPTION = "A tool to check operability of computer hardware and upload result \
to the Linux hardware database. \
 \
Probe â€” is a snapshot of your computer hardware state and system \
logs. The tool checks operability of devices by analysis of logs \
and returns a permanent url to view the probe of the computer. \
 \
The tool is intended to simplify collecting of logs necessary for \
investigating hardware related problems. Just run one simple \
command in the console to check your hardware and collect all the \
system logs at once: \
 \
    sudo -E hw-probe -all -upload \
 \
By creating probes you contribute to the HDD/SSD Real-Life \
Reliability Test study: https://github.com/linuxhw/SMART"
