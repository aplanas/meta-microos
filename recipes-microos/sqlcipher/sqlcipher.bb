SUMMARY = "SQLite database encryption"
DESCRIPTION = "SQLCipher is an SQLite extension that provides transparent 256-bit AES \
encryption of database files. Pages are encrypted before being written to \
disk and are decrypted when read back. Due to the small footprint and great \
performance itâ€™s ideal for protecting embedded application databases and is \
well suited for mobile development."
