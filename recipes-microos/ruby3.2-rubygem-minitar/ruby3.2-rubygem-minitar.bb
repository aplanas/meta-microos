SUMMARY = "The minitar library is a pure-Ruby library that provides the ability"
DESCRIPTION = "The minitar library is a pure-Ruby library that provides the ability to deal \
with POSIX tar(1) archive files. \
This is release 0.9, adding a minor feature to Minitar.unpack and \
Minitar::Input#extract_entry that when <tt>:fsync => false</tt> is provided, \
fsync will be skipped. \
minitar (previously called Archive::Tar::Minitar) is based heavily on code \
originally written by Mauricio Julio Fern√°ndez Pradier for the rpa-base \
project."
