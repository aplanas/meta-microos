SUMMARY = "Open Test Alliance for the JVM"
DESCRIPTION = "Open Test Alliance for the JVM is a minimal common foundation for \
testing libraries on the JVM.  The primary goal of the project is to \
enable testing frameworks like JUnit, TestNG, Spock, etc. and \
third-party assertion libraries like Hamcrest, AssertJ, etc. to use a \
common set of exceptions that IDEs and build tools can support in a \
consistent manner across all testing scenarios -- for example, for \
consistent handling of failed assertions and failed assumptions as \
well as visualization of test execution in IDEs and reports."
