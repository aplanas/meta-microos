SUMMARY = "Fork of Python 3 pickle module"
DESCRIPTION = "This package presents a uniform pickling interface for ZODB: \
 * Under Python2, this package forks both Python 2.7â€™s pickle and \
   cPickle modules, adding support for the protocol 3 opcodes. \
   It also provides a new subclass of bytes, zodbpickle.binary, \
   which Python2 applications can use to pickle binary values such \
   that they will be unpickled as bytes under Py3k. \
 * Under Py3k, this package forks the pickle module (and the \
   supporting C extension) from both Python 3.2 and Python 3.3. \
   The fork add support for the noload operations used by ZODB."
