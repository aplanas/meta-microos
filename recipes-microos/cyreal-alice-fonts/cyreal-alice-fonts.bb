SUMMARY = "Alice Font"
DESCRIPTION = "Ksenia Erulevich, designer of the Alice typeface, was inspired by Lewis \
Carrolâ€™s novel and decided to make a typeface that will be suitable for \
typesetting that book. \
 \
It came out eclectic and quaint, old-fashioned, having widened \
proportions, open aperture, and soft rounded features; perfect for long \
meditative text-setting and headlines."
