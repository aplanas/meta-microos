SUMMARY = "Find regular expressions vulnerable to ReDoS"
DESCRIPTION = "Many default regular expression parsers have unbounded worst-case complexity. \
Regex matching may be quick when presented with a matching input string. \
However, certain non-matching input strings can make the regular expression \
matcher go into crazy backtracking loops and take ages to process. This can \
cause denial of service, as the CPU will be stuck trying to match the regex. \
 \
This tool is designed to: \
* find regular expressions which are vulnerable to ReDoS \
* give an example malicious string which will cause catastrophic backtracking \
 \
Supports: \
- C# \
- JavaScript/TypeScript (requires node to be installed) \
- JSON \
- Python \
- YAML"
