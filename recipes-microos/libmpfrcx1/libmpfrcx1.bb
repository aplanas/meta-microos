SUMMARY = "Multi-precision floating-point interval arithmetic computation library"
DESCRIPTION = "MPFRCX is a library for the arithmetic of univariate polynomials over \
arbitrary precision real or complex numbers, without control on the \
rounding. \
 \
The motivation for the library is to have functionality available for \
the floating-point approach to complex multiplication. \
Asymptotically-fast routines such as Toomâ€“Cook and the FFT for \
multiplication of polynomials are available, as well as fast routines \
for interpolation and evaluation based on trees of polynomials."
