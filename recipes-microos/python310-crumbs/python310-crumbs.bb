SUMMARY = "Generalized all-in-one parameters module"
DESCRIPTION = "This package provides a single interface to environment variables', \
configuration files', and command line arguments' provided values.  The \
dictionary-like interface makes interacting with these, most of the time \
disparate, resources much simpler.  It also allows parameters' values to be set \
in any of the three sources and selects an appropriate value when a parameter's \
value is specified in multiple sources.  This way the most expected value, \
according to the normal prcedenceâ€”command line arguments then configuration \
files then environment variables, is always returned."
