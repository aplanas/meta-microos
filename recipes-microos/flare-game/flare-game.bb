SUMMARY = "Free Libre Action Roleplaying Engine â€” Game"
DESCRIPTION = "Flare (Free Libre Action Roleplaying Engine) is a simple game engine built \
to handle a very specific kind of game: single-player 2D action RPGs. \
Flare is not a reimplementation of an existing game or engine. It is a \
tribute to and exploration of the action RPG genre. \
 \
Rather than building a very abstract, robust game engine, the goal of this \
project is to build several real games and harvest an engine from the common, \
reusable code. The first game, in progress, is a fantasy dungeon crawl. \
 \
Flare uses simple file formats (INI style config files) for most of the \
game data, allowing anyone to easily modify game contents. Open formats \
are preferred (png, ogg). The game code is C++."
