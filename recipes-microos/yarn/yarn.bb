SUMMARY = "üì¶üêà Fast, reliable, and secure dependency management"
DESCRIPTION = "Fast: Yarn caches every package it has downloaded, so it never needs to \
download the same package again. It also does almost everything concurrently to \
maximize resource utilization. This means even faster installs. \
 \
Reliable: Using a detailed but concise lockfile format and a deterministic \
algorithm for install operations, Yarn is able to guarantee that any \
installation that works on one system will work exactly the same on another \
system. \
 \
Secure: Yarn uses checksums to verify the integrity of every installed package \
before its code is executed."
